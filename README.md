# C++20 Modules Playground

This repository is just a personal playground for C++20 modules.
Even in December of 2022 everything still feels super experimental.

This was only tested with Visual Studio 2022, your mileage may vary.

Filenames do not always correspond to module/partition names or namespaces.
We use the convention of having the module name as prefix, followed by string describing the content of the file uniquely among the module.
